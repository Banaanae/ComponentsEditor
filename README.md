# ComponentsEditor

A website to create custom items with components in Minecraft

## Features
* Optimised command generation to fit more components within length limits
* Command chunking so many components can be applied within text window

## Thanks
* The [minecraft wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format), which has all the documentation used to create this tool
